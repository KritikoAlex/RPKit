# This file is where in game messages may be configured.
# If you're only running rpk-core-bukkit this will be empty.
# If you're already running some RPKit plugins, you may see some messages you can set.
# If your server's native language is English, there probably aren't any reasons you'd want to configure this.
# If the people on your server speak another language though, you can replace this file with a translated one for your
# language.
